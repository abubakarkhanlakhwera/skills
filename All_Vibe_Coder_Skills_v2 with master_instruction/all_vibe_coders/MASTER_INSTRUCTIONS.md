# 🗺️ MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md — v2.0.0
> **Single entry point for full-stack projects using multiple Vibe Coder skills.**
> Drop this file in the root of any project. The AI reads it first, every session, no exceptions.
> It tells the AI which skill governs which layer, what rules apply everywhere, and how to behave across the whole stack.

---

## 🧠 How the AI Must Use This File

1. **Read this file first** — before reading any skill file, before writing any code
2. **Identify the task layer** — use the Skill Routing Table below to pick the right skill(s)
3. **Read the skill's INSTRUCTIONS.md** — load the rules for the relevant layer only
4. **Apply cross-skill rules** — the rules in this file override all individual skill rules
5. **Stay in one lane** — do not switch skills mid-response; finish one layer at a time
6. **Update SESSION_LOG.md** — at the end of every session, no matter which skill was active

## ⚡ Session Start Ritual (Every Session, No Exceptions)

```
1. Read MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md  ← this file
2. Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md      ← current project state, task, known issues
3. Identify task layer           ← use Skill Routing Table above
4. Read skill INSTRUCTIONS.md   ← load rules for the active layer
5. Read STACK_VERSIONS.md       ← get pinned versions
6. Resolve Context7              ← use context7 → resolve-library-id for active libs
7. Ask ONE clarifying question   ← only if task is genuinely ambiguous
8. Start work
```

> If PROJECT_CONTEXT.md has not been filled in, stop and ask the developer to fill it in first.
> A session without context is a session that produces the wrong output.

## 🔗 Cross-Skill Rules (Override All Individual Skill Rules)

These rules apply across every layer, every file, every session.
No individual skill can contradict these.

### Context & Documentation
- **Context7 is always on** — resolve library docs before writing any library-specific code, in any language, in any layer
- **STACK_VERSIONS.md is the source of truth** — use its versions when resolving Context7 docs, not latest
- **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md must be read first** — never start work without knowing the current task and known issues

### Code Quality
- **One thing at a time** — never refactor one layer while building a feature in another
- **No cross-layer refactoring** — if you spot a backend issue while working on frontend, note it in SESSION_LOG.md and move on
- **Minimum viable change** — make the smallest change that accomplishes the task; no bonus improvements
- **Never rewrite working code** across any layer without explicit permission

### API Contracts
- **Consistent error shape across all services:**
  ```json
  { "error": { "code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "Human readable message" } }
  ```
- **Consistent success shape for list endpoints:**
  ```json
  { "data": [...], "meta": { "total": 0, "page": 1, "pageSize": 20 } }
  ```
- **Never break an existing API contract** without updating all consumers and noting in DECISIONS.md

### Security (All Layers)
- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, tokens, or credentials in any file in any layer
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII, payment info) in any layer
- Validate all user input at the layer that receives it — never trust upstream validation alone
- Use HTTPS/TLS everywhere — no plain HTTP in any production service

### Logging & Observability
- Structured JSON logging in all backend services — never plain text console output in production
- Consistent log fields across services: `{ "level", "timestamp", "service", "message", "traceId" }`
- Every API request gets a `traceId` — propagated via headers between services

### Session Hygiene
- **SESSION_LOG.md updated at end of every session** — what changed, what was decided, next step
- **DECISIONS.md updated** when any non-obvious architectural choice is made
- **CHANGELOG.md updated** for every user-facing or API-facing change
- **Never end a session without ➡️ Next step**

## 🏗️ Full-Stack Project Templates
> Copy the relevant template into your own project's MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md.
> Delete skills you don't use. Add your project-specific cross-skill rules below.

### Template A — Next.js SaaS (Frontend + Backend + Infra)
```
Active Skills:
  Frontend  → nextjs-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Backend   → fastapi-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md   (or nodejs-backend-vibe-coder)
  Infra     → docker-compose-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Cloud     → terraform-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Always    → context7-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md

Project-Specific Cross-Skill Rules:
  - API base URL: all frontend fetches go to /api/v1/
  - Auth token: stored in httpOnly cookie, passed as Bearer in API calls
  - All mutations go through Server Actions — no client-side POST to /api
```

### Template B — Mobile App (React Native + Node.js API)
```
Active Skills:
  Mobile    → react-native-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Backend   → nodejs-backend-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Infra     → docker-compose-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Always    → context7-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md

Project-Specific Cross-Skill Rules:
  - API versioning: /api/v1/ for all routes
  - Auth: JWT stored in expo-secure-store on mobile, validated in Node middleware
  - Push notifications: Expo push tokens stored in users table
```

### Template C — Desktop App (Tauri + FastAPI)
```
Active Skills:
  Desktop   → tauri-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Backend   → fastapi-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Always    → context7-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md

Project-Specific Cross-Skill Rules:
  - Local API runs on localhost:8000, started by Tauri sidecar
  - IPC for OS-level features (file system, tray), HTTP for business logic
  - All sensitive config in Tauri keychain — never in FastAPI config files
```

### Template D — Data Platform (dbt + Streamlit + LangChain)
```
Active Skills:
  Transform → dbt-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Dashboard → streamlit-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  AI Layer  → langchain-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Infra     → docker-compose-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Always    → context7-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md

Project-Specific Cross-Skill Rules:
  - dbt marts are the single source of truth — Streamlit reads from marts only
  - LangChain retrieves from vector store built on dbt mart data
  - All Streamlit secrets via .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

### Template E — Enterprise Monorepo (Spring Boot + Next.js + Terraform)
```
Active Skills:
  Frontend  → nextjs-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Backend   → spring-boot-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Cloud     → terraform-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Infra     → docker-compose-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Always    → context7-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md

Project-Specific Cross-Skill Rules:
  - Spring Security OAuth2 resource server — Next.js passes Bearer token on every API call
  - DTOs only in REST responses — never JPA entities
  - Terraform manages all AWS resources — no manual console changes
```

### Template F — Flutter Mobile + NestJS API
```
Active Skills:
  Mobile    → flutter-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Backend   → nestjs-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Infra     → docker-compose-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Always    → context7-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md

Project-Specific Cross-Skill Rules:
  - Dio for all HTTP in Flutter — typed response models from shared contract
  - NestJS returns camelCase JSON — Flutter deserializes with json_serializable
  - Auth: JWT in flutter_secure_storage, refreshed via NestJS /auth/refresh
```

### Template G — Electron Desktop + Go API
```
Active Skills:
  Desktop   → electron-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Backend   → go-gin-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md
  Always    → context7-vibe-coder/INSTRUCTIONS.md

Project-Specific Cross-Skill Rules:
  - Go API runs as a local sidecar process managed by Electron main process
  - IPC for system features, HTTP to localhost for all business logic
  - Credentials stored via keytar in Electron — never passed to Go process directly
```

## 💬 Prompt Patterns for Multi-Skill Sessions

### Start a session
```
Read MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md and PROJECT_CONTEXT.md.
My task: [describe task].
Active skills: [skill-1], [skill-2], context7.
```

### Switch layers mid-session
```
Switching to [backend / frontend / infra].
Read [skill-folder]/INSTRUCTIONS.md for this part.
```

### Full-stack feature (end to end)
```
Read MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md.
Build [feature] end-to-end: [frontend layer] + [backend layer].
Follow each layer's INSTRUCTIONS.md. Do frontend first, then backend.
```

### Debug a cross-layer issue
```
Read MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md.
I have a bug that crosses [frontend] and [backend].
Read both skills' INSTRUCTIONS.md before diagnosing.
Use the debugging protocol from each skill's INSTRUCTIONS.md.
```

### Architecture decision
```
Read MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md and DECISIONS.md.
I need to decide [decision topic].
Consider the cross-skill rules and existing decisions before recommending.
Log the decision in DECISIONS.md when done.
```

### End-of-session wrap-up
```
Session complete. Update SESSION_LOG.md with:
- what was changed (files + summary)
- decisions made (log in DECISIONS.md too if architectural)
- any new anti-patterns discovered (add to ANTI_PATTERNS.md)
- next step
```

## 🚫 Hard Rules — Never Break Across Any Skill

- ❌ Never apply skill A's rules to skill B's code
- ❌ Never start work without reading PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
- ❌ Never skip Context7 for library-specific code in any layer
- ❌ Never break the cross-skill error shape contract
- ❌ Never end a session without updating SESSION_LOG.md
- ❌ Never make changes in two layers simultaneously in one response
- ❌ Never suggest a cross-layer architectural change without logging it in DECISIONS.md
- ❌ Never hardcode credentials or secrets in any file in any layer
