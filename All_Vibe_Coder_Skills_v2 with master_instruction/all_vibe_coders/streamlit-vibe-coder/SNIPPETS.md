# 🧩 SNIPPETS.md — Streamlit Approved Code Snippets
> Curated, project-approved patterns for common tasks.
> The AI pulls from here before generating from scratch.
> Add new snippets after code review — these are the gold standard.

## How to Use This File
When asking the AI to implement something, say:
> "Use the approved snippet from SNIPPETS.md as a starting point"

The AI will adapt the snippet to the specific context rather than generating from scratch.

## Core Snippets

### Cached DB connection
```python
@st.cache_resource
def get_engine():
    return create_engine(st.secrets["database"]["url"])

@st.cache_data(ttl=300)
def load_items() -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM items", get_engine())
```


## Adding New Snippets
1. Write the code the normal way
2. After review, extract the pattern here
3. Add a clear name and brief description
4. Commit with message: `snippets(streamlit): add [name]`
