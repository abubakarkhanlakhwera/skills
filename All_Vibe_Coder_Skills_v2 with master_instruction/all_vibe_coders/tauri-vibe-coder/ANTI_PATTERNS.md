# 🚫 ANTI_PATTERNS.md — Tauri Rejected Patterns
> These patterns were tried and rejected in this project.
> The AI must NEVER suggest these, even if they seem reasonable.
> Add entries after a post-mortem or code review finding.

## Rejected Patterns
- .unwrap() or .expect() in command handlers — always propagate errors
- window.__TAURI__ access directly — always use @tauri-apps/api wrappers
- Blocking the async runtime with std::thread::sleep — use tokio::time::sleep
- Storing secrets in app config files — use tauri-plugin-keychain

## Rejected Libraries
| Library | Why Rejected | Preferred Alternative |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| [library] | [reason — e.g., caused memory leaks in prod] | [what to use instead] |

## Rejected Architectural Decisions
| Decision | Why Rejected | What We Do Instead |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| [e.g., ORM for raw reporting queries] | Too slow, N+1 | Raw SQL via sqlc/Dapper |

## War Stories (Learn From These)
> Brief incident summaries that justify the anti-patterns above.
