# 🚫 ANTI_PATTERNS.md — NestJS Rejected Patterns
> These patterns were tried and rejected in this project.
> The AI must NEVER suggest these, even if they seem reasonable.
> Add entries after a post-mortem or code review finding.

## Rejected Patterns
- Business logic in controllers — always services
- Manual DTO validation — always class-validator decorators + ValidationPipe
- Direct TypeORM repository injection in controllers — service layer only
- process.env direct access — always ConfigService

## Rejected Libraries
| Library | Why Rejected | Preferred Alternative |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| [library] | [reason — e.g., caused memory leaks in prod] | [what to use instead] |

## Rejected Architectural Decisions
| Decision | Why Rejected | What We Do Instead |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| [e.g., ORM for raw reporting queries] | Too slow, N+1 | Raw SQL via sqlc/Dapper |
