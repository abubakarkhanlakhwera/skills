# 🚫 ANTI_PATTERNS.md — LangChain Rejected Patterns
> These patterns were tried and rejected in this project.
> The AI must NEVER suggest these, even if they seem reasonable.
> Add entries after a post-mortem or code review finding.

## Rejected Patterns
- Legacy LLMChain, SequentialChain — always LCEL
- f-string prompt construction — always ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages()
- Synchronous chain calls in FastAPI handlers — always ainvoke/astream
- Hard-coding chunk_size without profiling retrieval quality

## Rejected Libraries
| Library | Why Rejected | Preferred Alternative |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| [library] | [reason — e.g., caused memory leaks in prod] | [what to use instead] |

## Rejected Architectural Decisions
| Decision | Why Rejected | What We Do Instead |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| [e.g., ORM for raw reporting queries] | Too slow, N+1 | Raw SQL via sqlc/Dapper |
